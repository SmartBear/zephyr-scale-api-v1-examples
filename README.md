# Use case examples using the API v1 of Test Management for Jira

This repository has some usage examples of the API v1 of Test Management for Jira (Server).

## How to run examples

The examples are built using NodeJs. In order to run them, you need to install the modules listed in `package.json` file by running `npm install`. Then, you can run each example separately by opening a terminal and specifying the file you want to run, for example:
`node examples/createTestCasesFromIssues.js`

All examples are independent from each other, and they have no other dependencies apart from the ones listed on `package.json`.
